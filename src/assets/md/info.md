## Welcome Citizen!

In 2945 in the middle of the wars, a group of people came together to scout new riches in the Stanton System. After a few months they found a strong Quantinium field within the Aaron Halo Asteroid Belt. Years later a community slowly developed around a common goal. Today we celebrate our community by sharing our discoveries and helping new star farers to find their own riches.

We are the DeepSpace Exploration and Research Community - a community with a common goal to explore new worlds and bring back the best resources to the people of the belt and our strategic partners. Our operations spans the entire Stanton System and beyond. 

We invite anyone to join us and become a true belter.
